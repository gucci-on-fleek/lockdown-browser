        What did you expect to happen? For example:
        - I expected that the PowerShell script wouldn't give me this error message.
        - I expected that the _Windows Sandbox_ wouldn't crash.
        - I expected that the _Lockdown Browser_ wouldn't detect that it's running inside a virtual machine.
        - I expected my webcam to work properly inside the _Windows Sandbox_.

        If you can't describe what _should_ happen, then this is probably a question and is better suited for a [discussion](https://github.com/gucci-on-fleek/lockdown-browser/discussions/new).
